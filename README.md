# mc-things
These are projects that use mc-things IoT devices. You can learn about them here http://www.mcthings.com

This could fairly easily be adapted to other devices as well, although the mc-script would require translation 
to another device, the python code is a great example of several python libraries using MQTT (paho), JSON and Postgres.
